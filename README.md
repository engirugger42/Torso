# Torso

tail and head are soon to be dead with this new tool. Who cares about the tail of a log? By then, your program crashed and burned and you have no idea why, but it'll give you a thousand stack trace telling you in painstaking detail just how excruciatingly painful the computer finds your code. And when was the last time you honestly thought "I know, I can solve this mystery by looking at the first 10 lines of a file with head!" That's right, never. The head of a file is full of #include, #ifndef, and self serving comments about how great the author is for coming up with a script that tells you the weather in Zimbabwe, or whatever equally useless thing you're passing through head, because no self respecting CLI user is going to use head for real work. Seriously, just crack open the file in vi. You use emacs*? Well, my bad, you and your probably arthritic hands carry on with your ctrl^c ctrl^X ctrl^y antics. We don't need your kind here.

Then there's torso. torso knows whats up. torso knows that, just like most snack cakes and animals , the good stuff is in the middle. torso will default to showing 10 lines, just like good old (pointless) tail and head. And just like good old (completely worthless) tail and head (ever notice tail gets mentioned first? That shows how stupid head is) if you feed it -n X, it'll show you X lines. But not just any X lines. Using advanced science techniques, it finds the midpoint of the file, and shows you the lines X/2 lines above the midpoint and X/2 lines below the midpoint. Get out of the way, Elon Musk, I just schooled you. Enjoy torso. 

*This goes for nano users too. Pico users...what are you even doing with your life?
